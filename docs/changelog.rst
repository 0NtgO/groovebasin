Fixes:

1.0.0 (March 15, 2014)
----------------------

In the 1.0.0 release, Groove Basin has removed its dependency on MPD, using 
`libgroove`_ for audio playback and streaming support. Groove Basin is also not 
written in `coco`_ anymore. Hopefully this will encourage more contributors to
join the project!

Major features include `ReplayGain`_ style automatic loudness detection using the 
`EBU R128`_ recommendation. Scanning takes place on the fly, taking advantage of 
multi-core systems. Groove Basin automatically switches between album and track 
mode depending on the next item in the play queue.

Chat and playlist functionality have been removed as they are not quite ready 
yet. These features will be reimplemented better in a future release.

Other features:

* Groove Basin now functions as an MPD server. MPD clients can connect to port 
  6600 by default.
* The config file is simpler and should survive new version releases.
* Client and server communications now use a simpler and more efficient protocol.
* Rebuilding the album index is faster.
* The HTTP audio stream buffers much more quickly and flushes the buffer on seek.
* Streaming shows when it is buffering.
* The web UI now specifies a `UTF-8`_ character set.
* Groove Basin's music library now updates automatically by watching the music 
  folder for changes.
* HTTP streaming now uses native HTML5 audio, instead of `SoundManager 2`_
* `jQuery`_ and `jQuery UI`_ have been updated to the latest stable version, fixing
  some UI glitches.
* Static assets are gzipped and held permanently in memory, making the web 
  interface load faster.
* Now routing Dynamic mode through the permissions framework.
* Better default password generation.

Fixes:

* Fixed a regression for handling unknown artists or albums.
* Fixed play queue to display the artist name of tracks.
* Plugged an upload security hole.
* Pressing the previous track button on the first track in the play queue when
  "repeat all" is turned on now plays the last track in the play queue.
* The volume widget no longer goes higher than 100%.
* Changing the volume now shows up on other clients.
* The volume keyboard shortcuts now work in Firefox.
* Ensured that no-cache headers are set for the stream.
* Fixed an issue in the Web UI where the current track was sometimes not 
  displayed.

Thanks to Josh Wolfe, who worked to fix some issues around deleting library
items, ensuring that deleting library items removes them from the play queue, 
and that the play queue correctly reacts to deleted library entries.

In addition, he worked to:

* Convert Groove Basin to not use MPD.
* fix multiselect shiftIds.
* fix shift click going up in the queue.
