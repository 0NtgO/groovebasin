 * (andy) fix broken plugin - lastfm
 * (andy) replaygain scan when a song enters library
 * (andy) automatically set track or album replaygain depending on nearby playlist items
 * persist current playlist
 * support mpd protocol on a different port
 * streaming with libgroove
 * if you delete a song from the library that is on the current playlist, it
   makes groove basin unable to load
 * sometimes queuing an album puts the tracks in the wrong order. I suspect client side bug
 * src/client/app.js: separate plugins into separate files
 * named playlist support
 * ditch handlebars
 * replace socket.io with https://github.com/einaros/ws
 * ditch qq fileuploader 
 * player: finer-grained updates. 'playlistUpdate' shouldn't be the only kind of update
   - also should utilize the player's 'delete' and 'update' events for library changes
 * player should notice when you delete a file while it is not running.
 * implement auto-queue on upload.
   - I think it should be done by the client. This would solve uploading an
     album in the correct order, assuming the files are alphabetically sorted
     by track number.
 * all commands should be registered with player server and go through the
   permissions framework. this includes plugins such as chat and dynamicmode
