* add tests
* seeker bar
* display track time
* same track multiple times in playlist doesn't show up
* sometimes updatePlaylist and updateStatus get into a loop calling each other
* handle albums better
  - when two different artists have samely titled album
  - albums with various artists

Server TODO:
 * serve downloadable songs 
 * accept uploaded songs and add them to library
 * library management
   - ability to add a song to the library
   - duplicate detection and elimination
     > if a song is byte for byte the same (check md5's) then ignore the
       new song
     > use heuristics to guess if songs are probably the same (using tags). if
       we are reasonably confident that the songs are the same, delete the one
       with the lower quality.
     > if we're not confident enough, there will be an
       api that lists possible duplicates and actions to resolve them.
   - when a song is added to the library, automatically replaygain scan it
     and the album from whence it came. Do this for update as well.
   - ability to add song to library by URL
 * plugin API
   - plugin to submit songs to last.fm
   - plugin to import songs to library from youtube URL
 * dynamic playlist mode
   - togglable
     > ON:
       ~ songs older than 10 songs ago are auto-removed from playlist
       ~ if the playlist is less than 20 songs long, a new random song is added
       ~ good shuffle heuristics:
         # recently played songs have less probability of being randomly chosen
         # songs that get skipped more often have less probability of being
           randomly chosen.
       ~ there are 4 sections to the dynamic playlist
         # history of 10 songs
         # the currently playing song
         # the "manually" queued songs that will play next
         # the auto-shuffle queued list of 10 songs that will play after the 
           manual section is done. at any time you can move one of these songs
           to the manual section.
     > OFF:
       ~ playlist is only changed manually.
