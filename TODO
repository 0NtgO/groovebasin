High priority:
 * (andy) ditch mpd

Before merging into master:
 * consider using https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup
   - separate state from configuration
 * fix broken plugin - upload
   - while you're at it consider ditching qq fileuploader
 * fix broken plugin - delete
 * fix broken plugin - download
 * fix broken plugin - lastfm
 * fix broken plugin - dynamicmode
 * finish converting mpd-specific protocol (named playlist support)
 * persist current playlist
 * fix the TODOs strewn about the code
 * support mpd protocol on a different port

Eventually:
 * eliminate the TODOs in the code
 * ditch handlebars
 * replace socket.io with https://github.com/einaros/ws
 * ditch qq fileuploader 
 * extract the skewed random song selection into a separate, tested module
 * make dynamic mode work with version of mpd that is in ubuntu 0.16.5-1ubuntu4 (raspberry pi is 0.16.7-2)
 * ditch watch (prefer https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)
