High priority:
 * (andy) fix volume

Before merging into master:
 * streaming with libgroove
 * fix broken plugin - upload
   - while you're at it consider ditching qq fileuploader
 * fix broken plugin - delete
 * fix broken plugin - download
 * fix broken plugin - lastfm
 * fix broken plugin - dynamicmode
 * fix broken plugin - chat
 * finish converting mpd-specific protocol (named playlist support)
 * persist current playlist
 * fix the TODOs strewn about the code
 * support mpd protocol on a different port

Eventually:
 * replaygain scan when a song enters library
 * automatically set track or album replaygain depending on nearby playlist items
 * ditch handlebars
 * replace socket.io with https://github.com/einaros/ws
 * ditch qq fileuploader 
 * extract the skewed random song selection into a separate, tested module
 * player: finer-grained updates. 'playlistUpdate' shouldn't be the only kind of update
