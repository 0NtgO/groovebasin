    > if a song is byte for byte the same (check md5's) then ignore the
      new song
    > use heuristics to guess if songs are probably the same (using tags). if
      we are reasonably confident that the songs are the same, delete the one
      with the lower quality.
    > if we're not confident enough, there will be an
      api that lists possible duplicates and actions to resolve them.
