Version 0.0.6
* some kind of makefile generator so we don't have to manually edit the makefile
* bug: if you select the last track in blink 182 enema of the state and press
  down, it goes to the wrong track next
* if you move a blue song such that it touches a non-blue song, it should lose
  its blueness
* ability to ban from random
  - keyboard shortcut 'B'
* ability to mark a playlist item as "stop after this track"

Version 0.0.7
* ability to password protect - make it so that not everybody can kill mpd,
  enable/disable audio outputs, edit tags, upload tracks, change playback
  state, etc.
* ability to delete songs from library
* ability to edit tags
* ability to move a file to a better location based on its tags

Backlog
* streaming button should show buffering percentage
* when uploading songs into library, make sure not to overwrite existing ones
* left in library on collapsed element should jump to parent 
* right in library after expanding element should jump to 1st child
* online user interaction:
  - join/left messages
  - user is typing notices (typically this is not done in a room with > 2 people)
  - attention grabbers for chat activity
  - surround chatted urls with <a>
  - queued tracks should know which user queued them
    > displayed as colors?
  - library songs should know which user uploaded them if any
    > this would require user authentication :-/
  - server-side chat logs
* shortcuts window should be scrollable with arrows
* shortcuts window doesn't close with Escape after a Ctrl+F in Chrome
* Time column disappears when window is too thin
* Time column can cut off part of 4-digit times
* option to not auto-queue uploaded songs
* smarter anticipation of commands to avoid the glitchy behavior when you do
  a repetitive action quickly, such as turning the volume down incrementally
  or moving a track down one space at a time
* make the list of uploaded files go away after they're all done.
* as part of lower casing for artist/album keys, change Ã± to n, etc.
  - like http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_5_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/ASCIIFoldingFilter.html
* shift+down select another item, shift+up unselect it
* hold ctrl to move cursor without selection

* dynamic mode populates twice when user clicks Clear
  - (due to mpd 'player' and 'playlist' events both being handled with empty playlist)
* display any mpd status error message
* ability to download multiple songs at once
* library management
  - duplicate detection and elimination
    > if a song is byte for byte the same (check md5's) then ignore the
      new song
    > use heuristics to guess if songs are probably the same (using tags). if
      we are reasonably confident that the songs are the same, delete the one
      with the lower quality.
    > if we're not confident enough, there will be an
      api that lists possible duplicates and actions to resolve them.
  - when a song is added to the library, automatically replaygain scan it
