ditch handlebars
replace socket.io with https://github.com/einaros/ws
finish converting mpd-specific protocol (named playlist support)
persist current playlist
ditch watch (prefer https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)
work on node-musicmetadata and support more formats/songs (such as wma)
use mpd.js https://github.com/superjoe30/mpd.js
ditch mpd
use diacritics module: https://github.com/superjoe30/diacritics
consider using https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup
ditch qq fileuploader 
extract the skewed random song selection into a separate, tested module
make dynamic mode work with version of mpd that is in ubuntu 0.16.5-1ubuntu4 (raspberry pi is 0.16.7-2)
