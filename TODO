    > ON:
      ~ songs older than 10 songs ago are auto-removed from playlist
      ~ if the playlist is less than 20 songs long, a new random song is added
      ~ good shuffle heuristics:
        # recently played songs have less probability of being randomly chosen
        # songs that get skipped more often have less probability of being
          randomly chosen.
      ~ there are 4 sections to the dynamic playlist
        # history of 10 songs
        # the currently playing song
        # the "manually" queued songs that will play next
        # the auto-shuffle queued list of 10 songs that will play after the 
          manual section is done. at any time you can move one of these songs
          to the manual section. the "repopulate" button only affects this area
    > OFF:
      ~ playlist is only changed manually.

    > if a song is byte for byte the same (check md5's) then ignore the
      new song
    > use heuristics to guess if songs are probably the same (using tags). if
      we are reasonably confident that the songs are the same, delete the one
      with the lower quality.
    > if we're not confident enough, there will be an
      api that lists possible duplicates and actions to resolve them.
