High priority:
(andy) get duration from mpd on playlist update
(josh) diverge playerclient.js duplication
ditch jspackage in favor of browserfy

Eventually:
fix the broken plugins
eliminate the TODOs in the code
ditch handlebars
replace socket.io with https://github.com/einaros/ws
finish converting mpd-specific protocol (named playlist support)
persist current playlist
work on node-musicmetadata and support more formats/songs (such as wma)
use mpd.js https://github.com/superjoe30/mpd.js
ditch mpd
use diacritics module: https://github.com/superjoe30/diacritics
consider using https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup
  - separate state from configuration
ditch qq fileuploader 
extract the skewed random song selection into a separate, tested module
make dynamic mode work with version of mpd that is in ubuntu 0.16.5-1ubuntu4 (raspberry pi is 0.16.7-2)
ditch watch (prefer https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)
