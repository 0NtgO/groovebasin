== Groove Basin ==

    Multiplayer music player for your home or office.

    Run it on a server connected to your main speakers. Anyone can connect and
    freely play and share music.

    Inspired by https://github.com/royvandewater/partybeat/

== Dependencies ==

    node.js (nodejs.org)

        After installing node.js, install npm (node package manager) and then
        install most groovebasin dependencies:

            $ sudo npm link

        Unfortunately we have to install some manually because we need their
        binaries. There's a better way to do this, but for now...

            $ sudo npm install -g uglify-js handlebars coffee-script

    mpd (musicpd.org)
        Compile from source; we depend on some new stuff.

    sass (sass-lang.com)
        On Ubuntu, be sure to install with the ruby gem, not with apt-get.
        And then make sure the `sass` executable is in your PATH.

== Installation ==

    1. Install and configure mpd, make sure it works.

    2. Compile:

        $ make

    3. Configure by placing a JSON file in `~/.groovebasinrc`. You can see
       what the structure should look like at the top of `groovebasind` source.

    4. You can now run `groovebasind` to start the server.

== Developing ==

    Auto-comile with DEBUG on:

        $ watch -n0.5 make -e DEBUG=true
