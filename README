== Groove Basin ==

    Music player for your home.

    Run it on a server connected to your main speakers. People who come over to
    your home can connect and freely upload, download, and play music.

    Inspired by https://github.com/royvandewater/partybeat/

== Dependencies ==

    node.js
        socket.io
        node-static
        coffee-script
    mpd

        (TODO write docs for this)

    2. Compile and install:

    3. (TODO) You can now run `groovebasind` to start the server.
