== Groove Basin ==

    Music player for your home.

    Run it on a server connected to your main speakers. People who come over to
    your home can connect and freely upload, download, and play music.

    Inspired by https://github.com/royvandewater/partybeat/

== Dependencies ==

    node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
        Install these packages globally with npm (http://npmjs.org/):
            socket.io
            node-static
            coffee-script
            handlebars
            uglify-js
    mpd (http://www.musicpd.org/)
        * Note: recommended to compile from source to get the latest good stuff,
          for example replay gain support. However due to a bug
          (http://www.musicpd.org/mantis/view.php?id=3423) the latest commit
          that compiles is 3a9697adf268d780500cc53432efa4f164. This is the 
          version of mpd that groovebasin is currently developing with.

== Installation ==

    1. Install and configure mpd

    2. Compile:

        $ make

    3. You can now run `groovebasind` to start the server.

== Developing ==

    Auto-comile with DEBUG on:

        $ watch -n0.5 make -e DEBUG=true
